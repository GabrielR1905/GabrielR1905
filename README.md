- Frameworks and libraries such as Astro, TailwindCSS, and React

• Programming Languages 👨‍💻: 
- PHP and Apache servers
- Version control with Git and GitHub

• Databases 📊:

- Database management tools like DBeaver, PGadmin, and phpMyAdmin

• Design 🎨:

- Data analysis with PowerBI

• Other Skills 🙋🏽‍♂️:
- Physical prototyping with Arduino
- Knowledge of UI/UX, Design Thinking, effective presentations

In addition to my studies, I've participated in events like the Intercollegiate Datathon 2023 and the Hackathon "Desenlace 2024" in my country.
In my free time, I enjoy video games and basketball. I'm a patient, collaborative person who is open to listening to different opinions.
